	<h1>Java</h1>
	<br><br><br>
	<h2>If you have the game:</h2><br>
	<p>You can just go the multiplayer tab in minecraft and type in the following IP Address</p>
	<p>it doesn't matter what you call the server, just make sure you're on 1.19.4</p>
	<pre>
	  <code>
168.138.14.52
	  </code>
	</pre>

	<h2>If you don't have the game:</h2><br>
	<p>Presumably you already have Java installed, if not, download OpenJDK from <a target="_blank" href="https://adoptium.net/" style="color: #d3d3d3">here</a></p><br>
	<p>Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://prismlauncher.org/" style="color: #d3d3d3">this link</a> and download the Prism Launcher (a better minecraft launcher, faster too)</p>
	<p>Run the installer, this should either be an exe or a tar.gz file depending on your platform</p><br>
	<p>Select your language (English) and specify your Java installation and RAM. Choose Java version 17 (or whatever version you have installed), and make your minimum RAM a quarter of what you have installed, and your maximum RAM half of what you have installed</p>
	<p>To add an account, click "Settings" > "Accounts" > "Add". Here you can add your Minecraft account!</p><br>
	<p>Now just click add instance, click Modrinth on the left search "Fabulously Optimized", click the first one and then click okay. You should just be able to select the instance and click launch</p><br>
	<p>Once the game has launched, just go to the multiplayer tab and type in the IP Address from above :D</p>
